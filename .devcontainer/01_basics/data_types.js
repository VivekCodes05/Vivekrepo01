//two types of data types
//primitive ->7
      //1. number,
      //2. string,
      //3. boolean,
      //4. null,   let a=null
                //console.log(typeof a)     => object
      //5. undefined,    if a variable is declared but not assigned anything ,it is undefined
                    //  also "undefined" can be assigned to it
      //6. symbol,        used to make  variables and object differ and unique even if their value is same
          //let Id=Symbol("123") 
          //let Id2=Symbol("123")
          //console.log(Id==Id2)    => false
      //7. BigINT

//non primitive or reference
        //array,
                //let num=[1,2,3,4]
        // objects,     -> key value pair so everything inside {bracket} combindly called object
                        // also it can be assigned to a variable
                //{
             // name="india"
             // code=92}
        // function      ->it can also be assigned to a variable
                //function(){
                //console.log("hello")}
